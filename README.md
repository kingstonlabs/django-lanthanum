Django Lanthanum
================

Django Lanthanum allows you to add Dynamic [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) Fields to your models. These allow you to build complex documents according to a set of fixed criteria - since the schema is fixed, it is possible to properly interpret the data.

This could be applied to a wide variety of scenarios, but it is particularly useful for Blogging or CMS tools, where the data structure of a page document can vary significantly.
